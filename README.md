# Harmonix

Harmonix is an API that allows Users to be able to interface with a small musical database created with MongoDB. The User can request information about songs, artists, and genres, as well as add their favorite songs to their own list! 

Harmonix uses the MERN stack modeled with Mongoose in order to process HTTP requests and deliver information about music. The supported HTTP requests can be found in the documentation file.  

  P.S. - This is my first project doing any backend development!
